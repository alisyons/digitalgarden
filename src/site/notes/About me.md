## Welcome to my little corner of the web 🌱

My name is Alisa, I was born in 1999 and I currently live in Germany. I have a bachelor's degree in Media Engineering and a master's degree in Digital Games.

I really enjoy ==drawing, coding, music and video games==. In my free time I also do indoor rock climbing. 
### Why make this site?

I'm growing ==increasingly annoyed== with the current (2025) state of the internet, social media and algorithms. Nowadays it's impossible to take it slow when building an online presence, and you are bombarded by ads. Also I want to stay in touch with my coding skills and this site gives me enough of a playground without me having to build a site from scratch.

### What did you use to build this?

This site is made in Obsidian and published via the [Digital Garden Plugin](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/). I'm also using the [Ukiyo Theme](https://github.com/technerium/obsidian-ukiyo). Some site views (such as the topics pages) have data views coded by me using the [dataviewjs](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) framework. I have also incorporated some of my custom stylings on e.g. the tag color.

### Social media & other sites

Despite my disdain for social media I am forced to stay there as it's a way for me to connect with friends and strangers alike. 

You can find me on:

I also have [another website](https://wither-sable.vercel.app/) for my ==game development / worldbuilding projects==.
